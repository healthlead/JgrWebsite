# Static Deployment Solution for JGR Construction

## Current Situation
You have a beautiful, fully-featured React website running locally with:
- Professional styling with authentic JGR brand colors
- Interactive maps and contact forms
- Responsive design and navigation
- Multiple pages (Home, Services, Projects, About, Contact, FAQ, Blog)

## The Issue
The React build process is complex and GitHub Pages deployment keeps failing. You need a working website now.

## Recommended Solution: Use a Better Static Host

Instead of fighting with GitHub Pages, deploy to **Netlify** which handles React apps perfectly:

### 1. Deploy to Netlify (Easiest)
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up (free)
2. Click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
3. Connect your GitHub repository: `healthlead/JrgWebsite`
4. Set build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
5. Click "Deploy site"

**Your site will be live at a custom URL like: `jgr-construction.netlify.app`**

### 2. Alternative: Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Auto-detects Vite settings
4. Deploys automatically

### 3. Keep GitHub Pages as Backup
I've created a working static HTML version in `public/index.html` that will work on GitHub Pages as a fallback.

## Why This is Better
- **No build issues** - these platforms handle React builds perfectly
- **Custom domains** - easy to connect coav.com
- **Automatic deployments** - updates when you push to GitHub
- **Better performance** - optimized for React apps
- **Free** - both have generous free tiers

## Next Steps
1. Try Netlify deployment (5 minutes setup)
2. Once working, point your domain coav.com to the new site
3. Your professional JGR Construction website will be live with all features

This approach gets your beautiful website online immediately while avoiding GitHub Pages complexities.
