# Final Fix for GitHub Pages White Page

## Problem Summary
Your site at https://healthlead.github.io/JrgWebsite/ shows a white page because:
1. The React app bundle isn't being loaded
2. The base path needs to be correctly set for the subdirectory
3. Assets aren't being found at the correct paths

## Complete Solution

### Step 1: Update package.json (if needed)
Add homepage field for GitHub Pages:
```json
"homepage": "https://healthlead.github.io/JrgWebsite"
```

### Step 2: Build Command
The build must use the correct base path:
```bash
npx vite build --base /JrgWebsite/
```

### Step 3: Verify GitHub Actions Workflow
The workflow is already configured correctly to:
- Detect if using custom domain or GitHub subdirectory
- Build with correct base path
- Copy all necessary files

### Step 4: Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Pages deployment with correct base path"
git push origin main
```

### Step 5: Monitor Deployment
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Wait for workflow to complete
3. Check build logs for any errors

## What's Fixed
1. Base path set to `/JrgWebsite/` for your repository
2. Dynamic detection of custom domain vs subdirectory
3. All assets will load from correct paths
4. SPA routing will work correctly

## Testing
Once deployed, test these URLs:
- https://healthlead.github.io/JrgWebsite/
- https://healthlead.github.io/JrgWebsite/services
- https://healthlead.github.io/JrgWebsite/projects

The white page issue will be resolved once the workflow runs with these fixes.
