# GitHub Pages Deployment Fixed

## Issue Identified
The GitHub Actions workflow was not properly copying the required files for GitHub Pages deployment:
- `CNAME` file (for custom domain)
- `404.html` file (for SPA routing)

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed GitHub Actions Workflow
Updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to copy essential files:

```yaml
- name: Build
  run: |
    npx vite build
    cp CNAME dist/
    cp public/404.html dist/
```

### 2. Files Required for GitHub Pages
- **CNAME**: Contains `coav.com` for custom domain
- **404.html**: Handles client-side routing for single-page application
- **Built assets**: From Vite build process

### 3. Deployment Process
1. GitHub Actions triggers on push to main branch
2. Installs dependencies with `npm ci`
3. Builds the application with `npx vite build`
4. Copies CNAME and 404.html to dist folder
5. Uploads artifact to GitHub Pages
6. Deploys to `coav.com`

## Next Steps
1. The workflow will trigger automatically when this is committed to GitHub
2. Check the Actions tab in your repository for deployment progress
3. Site should be live at `https://coav.com` once deployment completes
4. The "DNS check in progress" should resolve to "DNS check successful"

## Expected Timeline
- Build and deployment: 2-3 minutes
- DNS recognition: Immediate (since DNS is already configured correctly)
- HTTPS certificate: May take up to 1 hour

The workflow fix addresses the core issue that was preventing GitHub Pages from serving your application.
