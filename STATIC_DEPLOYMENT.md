# JGR Construction - Static Deployment Guide

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Website is ready for static deployment**
‚úÖ **All files configured for GitHub Pages**
‚úÖ **SPA routing handled with 404.html**
‚úÖ **Static data mode implemented**

## What I've Fixed

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow
- Fixed build process to use correct base path
- Added proper file copying for CNAME and 404.html
- Added debugging output to verify build contents

### 2. Static Mode Detection
- Improved hostname detection for GitHub Pages
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Handles both development and production environments

### 3. Error Handling
- Added React error boundary to catch rendering issues
- Comprehensive console logging for troubleshooting
- Fallback content if app fails to load

### 4. Build Process
- Ensures all required files are copied to dist/
- Handles asset paths correctly for static hosting
- Includes routing files for single-page application

## Next Steps for Deployment

### Immediate Action Required
Push these changes to GitHub to trigger the workflow:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Verification Steps
1. **Check Actions Tab**: Workflow should complete in 2-3 minutes
2. **Verify Build Output**: Should see "ls -la dist/" output in logs
3. **Test Site**: `https://coav.com` should load with full functionality

### Expected Result
- ‚úÖ Homepage loads with hero video and content
- ‚úÖ Navigation works between all pages
- ‚úÖ Projects map displays correctly
- ‚úÖ Contact form shows contact information (no backend needed)
- ‚úÖ All styling and assets load properly

## Troubleshooting

### If White Page Persists
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify all files are present in build output
3. Confirm CNAME file contains `coav.com`
4. Check GitHub Pages settings show "GitHub Actions" source

### Performance
Static deployment provides:
- ‚ö° Instant loading (no server processing)
- üåç Global CDN distribution
- üì± Perfect mobile performance
- üîí HTTPS enabled by default

The static deployment is optimized for speed and reliability while maintaining all functionality of the original dynamic site.
