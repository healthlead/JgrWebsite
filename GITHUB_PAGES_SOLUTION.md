# GitHub Pages 404 Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Analysis
Your 404 errors on GitHub Pages were caused by multiple issues:

1. **SPA Routing**: GitHub Pages doesn't understand client-side routing (React Router/Wouter)
2. **API Dependencies**: Your app makes API calls to `/api/*` endpoints that don't exist on static hosting
3. **Build Configuration**: Need proper build process for static deployment

## Complete Solution Implemented

### 1. SPA Routing Fix ✅
- **`public/404.html`**: Redirects all 404s back to index.html with route preserved
- **`client/index.html`**: Added routing script to restore proper URLs
- **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment

### 2. Static Data Implementation ✅
- **`client/src/lib/static-data.ts`**: Complete static data for all projects and services
- **`client/src/lib/queryClient.ts`**: Updated to use static data when deployed
- **`client/src/components/contact-form.tsx`**: Modified to work without backend API

### 3. Environment Detection ✅
The app automatically detects if it's running on GitHub Pages vs. development:
```javascript
export const isStaticMode = () => {
  return !window.location.hostname.includes('localhost') && 
         !window.location.hostname.includes('replit');
};
```

## What Each File Does

### Core SPA Routing Files
- **`public/404.html`**: Catches all 404s and redirects to `/?/route`
- **`client/index.html`**: Converts `/?/route` back to `/route` when app loads

### Data Layer
- **`static-data.ts`**: Contains all your projects and services data
- **`queryClient.ts`**: Automatically uses static data on GitHub Pages, API in development

### Deployment
- **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`**: Builds and deploys automatically on every push

## How It Works

### Development Mode (Replit)
- Uses Express server with API endpoints
- Fetches data from `/api/projects`, `/api/services`, etc.
- Contact form submits to `/api/contact`

### Production Mode (GitHub Pages)
- Uses static data from imported files
- Contact form shows success message with direct contact info
- All routing handled client-side with 404.html fallback

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push all changes to GitHub**
2. **Go to repository Settings → Pages**
3. **Change Source to "GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from branch")
4. **Workflow will auto-build and deploy**

## Custom Domain Setup
Your `CNAME` file shows `coav.com` - this is correctly configured for custom domain.

## Testing the Fix

After deployment, test these URLs:
- `https://coav.com/` ✅ Should load homepage
- `https://coav.com/services` ✅ Should load services page
- `https://coav.com/projects` ✅ Should load projects page
- `https://coav.com/contact` ✅ Should load contact page

## Contact Form Behavior
On GitHub Pages, the contact form will:
- Show a loading state when submitted
- Display success message with direct contact information
- Not actually send emails (provides phone number and email for direct contact)

## File Structure Summary
```

Your site should now work perfectly on GitHub Pages with your custom domain!
