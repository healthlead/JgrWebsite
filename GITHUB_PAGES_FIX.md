# GitHub Pages White Page Fix - Complete Solution

## Root Cause Analysis

Your site shows a white page because:

1. **Path Configuration Issue**: The site is deployed at `/JrgWebsite/` but assets are trying to load from `/`
2. **Build Configuration**: The Vite build needs the correct base path for GitHub Pages
3. **Asset Loading**: JavaScript and CSS files are not loading due to incorrect paths

## Complete Fix Applied

### 1. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow
- Dynamically detects if using custom domain or GitHub Pages subdirectory
- Sets correct base path (`/JrgWebsite/` for github.io, `/` for custom domain)
- Copies all necessary assets (images, videos, 404.html)

### 2. Fixed 404.html for SPA Routing
- Dynamically determines path segments based on hostname
- Works for both github.io subdirectory and custom domains

### 3. Updated Static Mode Detection
- Properly detects GitHub Pages environment
- Handles both `github.io` and custom domain scenarios

### 4. Removed CNAME Temporarily
- Since you're testing with the default GitHub Pages URL
- Can be re-added later for custom domain deployment

## Next Steps

### 1. Push Changes to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Pages deployment - resolve white page issue"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Monitor GitHub Actions
- Go to Actions tab in your repository
- Wait for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow to complete (2-3 minutes)
- Check the build logs for any errors

### 3. Test the Site
- Visit: https://healthleaq.github.io/JrgWebsite/
- All pages should load correctly with proper styling
- Navigation should work between pages

### 4. Verify Console Output
Once deployed, browser console should show:
- "Static mode: true"
- No 404 errors for assets
- Successful React app initialization

## What Changed

1. **Base Path**: Now correctly set to `/JrgWebsite/` for GitHub Pages
2. **Asset Paths**: All scripts and styles use relative paths
3. **Build Process**: Ensures all files are copied to correct locations
4. **Environment Detection**: Properly identifies GitHub Pages deployment

## If Issues Persist

1. Clear browser cache and reload
2. Check GitHub Actions logs for build errors
3. Verify all files exist in the deployed artifact
4. Check browser console for specific error messages

The white page issue should be resolved once these changes are deployed.
