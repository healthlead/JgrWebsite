# Final Steps to Fix GitHub Pages White Page

## The Issue
Your site at https://healthlead.github.io/JrgWebsite/ loads HTML but the JavaScript/CSS assets are trying to load from wrong paths:
- Current: `/assets/index-BZ36iiBK.js` ❌
- Needed: `/JrgWebsite/assets/index-BZ36iiBK.js` ✅

## Solution: Force Rebuild on GitHub

Since I cannot push to your repository directly, you need to:

### Option 1: Force a Rebuild (Easiest)
1. Make a small change to trigger rebuild:
   ```bash
   echo " " >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Trigger rebuild - fix asset paths"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Wait for GitHub Actions to complete (2-3 minutes)

3. Check: https://healthlead.github.io/JrgWebsite/

### Option 2: Manual Build and Deploy
If Option 1 doesn't work:

1. Build locally with correct base:
   ```bash
   rm -rf dist
   npx vite build --outDir dist --base /JrgWebsite/
   cp public/404.html dist/
   ```

2. Check that index.html has correct paths:
   ```bash
   grep "assets" dist/index.html
   # Should show: /JrgWebsite/assets/...
   ```

3. Commit and push the dist folder

## Why This Will Work
- The GitHub Actions workflow is already configured correctly
- It sets `--base /JrgWebsite/` during build
- The issue is that the last deployment didn't use this base path
- A fresh build will fix the asset paths

## Verification
After deployment, check:
1. View page source at https://healthlead.github.io/JrgWebsite/
2. Script tags should show: `src="/JrgWebsite/assets/index-*.js"`
3. The page should load with full styling and functionality

The white page will be fixed once the rebuild completes with correct asset paths!
