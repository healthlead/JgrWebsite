# Netlify Deployment - The Reliable Solution

## Why Netlify Instead of GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages has strict limitations that make React deployments difficult:
- Complex build processes often fail
- Limited Node.js environment
- Subpath routing issues
- Configuration complexity

**Netlify is specifically designed for modern web apps like your React site.**

## Quick Netlify Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Sign Up
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Click "Sign up" and use your GitHub account

### Step 2: Deploy
1. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
2. Choose "Deploy with GitHub"
3. Select your repository: `healthlead/JrgWebsite`
4. Netlify auto-detects the settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
5. Click "Deploy site"

### Step 3: Get Your URL
- Your site will be live at: `https://wonderful-name-123456.netlify.app`
- You can customize this URL in site settings

### Step 4: Connect Your Domain (Optional)
1. In Netlify dashboard, go to "Domain settings"
2. Add custom domain: `coav.com`
3. Follow the DNS instructions

## Why This Works Better

✅ **Automatic deployments** - Updates when you push to GitHub  
✅ **No build failures** - Netlify handles React perfectly  
✅ **Fast global CDN** - Better performance than GitHub Pages  
✅ **Custom domains** - Easy SSL and DNS management  
✅ **Free tier** - Perfect for your business site  

## Your Site Will Have

- All the beautiful styling and branding we built
- Interactive contact forms and maps
- Mobile responsive design
- Fast loading times
- Professional appearance

This is the standard approach most React developers use. GitHub Pages is better for simple HTML sites, while Netlify excels at modern web applications.
