# Fix Your Replit Deployment - Show Astro Version with Logo & Video

## Current Status
✅ Astro build completed successfully - all 7 pages generated
✅ Logo and video files are in dist/ folder 
✅ All assets properly included (11MB video, logo, images)

## The Problem
Your deployment is showing the React version because package.json scripts point to the Express server instead of serving the built Astro files.

## Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Update Package.json Scripts
You need to manually edit package.json to change these lines:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "astro build",
  "start": "node serve-astro.js"
}
```

### Step 2: Deploy Again
1. After updating package.json, redeploy your app
2. Replit will now:
   - Build your Astro site (with logo and video)
   - Serve the static files instead of React

### Step 3: Verify Results
Your deployment will show:
- ✅ JGR Construction logo in navbar
- ✅ Video background on homepage  
- ✅ All construction images
- ✅ Professional company branding

## Alternative: Quick Test
Run this in Shell to test the fix:
```bash
node serve-astro.js
```

## What This Fixes
- Switches from React Express server to Astro static site
- Includes all your logo and video fixes
- Uses the professionally built version with proper assets

Your client will see the correct, polished website with all branding elements working.
