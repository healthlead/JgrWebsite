# DNS Fixed - Final Steps to Activate

## DNS Configuration ✅ CORRECT
Your Namecheap DNS is now properly configured:
- A Records: All 4 GitHub IPs pointing to apex domain
- CNAME: www pointing to coav.com

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Wait for DNS Propagation (10-15 minutes)
Your DNS changes need time to propagate globally.

### 2. GitHub Domain Reset
Go to your GitHub repository:
1. Settings → Pages
2. Remove `coav.com` from custom domain field
3. Save (leave it blank)
4. Wait 2-3 minutes
5. Re-add `coav.com` 
6. Save

This forces GitHub to recheck your DNS with the new configuration.

### 3. Expected Results
After the domain reset, you should see:
- "DNS check successful" in GitHub Pages
- Site accessible at https://coav.com
- HTTPS enforcement available (may take additional time)

### 4. Test URLs
Once working, verify these load:
- https://coav.com (main site)
- https://coav.com/services
- https://coav.com/projects  
- https://coav.com/contact

## Timeline
- DNS propagation: 10-15 minutes
- GitHub domain reset: Immediate effect
- HTTPS certificate: Up to 1 hour

Your DNS is correctly configured now. The domain reset should resolve the "DNS check in progress" status.
