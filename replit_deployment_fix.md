# Fix Replit Deployment to Show Astro Version

## The Problem
Your Replit deployment is running the React Express server instead of the Astro version with your logo and video fixes.

## The Solution
The `.replit` file is configured to run `npm run dev` which starts the React server. For deployment, you need to:

1. **Build the Astro site first:**
   ```bash
   npx astro build
   ```

2. **Update deployment configuration** to serve the built Astro files instead of running the React server.

## Quick Fix Steps:

### Option 1: Manual Build and Deploy
1. In Shell: `npx astro build`
2. This creates a `dist/` folder with your static Astro site
3. Deploy the `dist/` folder contents

### Option 2: Update Package.json Scripts
The deployment needs to:
- Build the Astro site (`npx astro build`)
- Serve the static files from `dist/`

## Why This Happened
- Your preview works because we manually started the Astro dev server
- Replit deployment uses the default scripts which run the React Express server
- The logo and video fixes are only in the Astro version

## Result After Fix
- ✅ JGR logo will appear in navbar
- ✅ Video background will work
- ✅ All your fixes will be live
