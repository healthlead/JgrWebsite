# DNS Check in Progress - Immediate Fix Steps

## What's Happening
Your GitHub Pages settings are correct, but showing "DNS Check in Progress". This is very common and usually resolves with these steps.

## Immediate Actions to Take

### Step 1: Check if Workflow Ran
1. Go to your repository **Actions** tab
2. Look for the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Has it run successfully? If not, that's the issue.

### Step 2: Quick DNS Reset (Most Effective)
1. Go to Settings â†’ Pages
2. Under "Custom domain", **remove** `coav.com`
3. **Save** (this removes the domain)
4. Wait 1-2 minutes
5. **Re-add** `coav.com` in the custom domain field
6. **Save** again

This often triggers GitHub to recheck DNS immediately.

### Step 3: Test if Site Actually Works
Even with "DNS Check in Progress", try visiting:
- `https://coav.com`
- `http://coav.com`

The site might actually be working despite the warning.

### Step 4: Verify DNS (If Needed)
Your domain DNS should point to GitHub's servers:
- A Records: `185.199.108.153`, `185.199.109.153`, `185.199.110.153`, `185.199.111.153`

## Expected Timeline
- **DNS Reset (Step 2)**: Works immediately (5-10 minutes)
- **Natural DNS Propagation**: 24-48 hours
- **Workflow Deployment**: 2-3 minutes after push

## Most Likely Outcome
The DNS reset (removing and re-adding the domain) usually fixes this immediately. It's the most effective solution for "DNS Check in Progress" issues.

## If Still Not Working After DNS Reset
1. Check that your GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully
2. Verify your domain's DNS settings point to GitHub
3. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation

The remove/re-add domain trick works 90% of the time for this exact issue.
